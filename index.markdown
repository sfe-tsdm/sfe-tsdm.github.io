# Systematic Feature Engineering for Time-Series Data Mining (SFE-TSDM)

Time-series are one of the most common data types in science, engineering, medicine, and economics.
    In many applications, not the sequential time-series itself but specific characteristics of these time-series are important features for analyzing and understanding the respective systems from which the time-series have been recorded.
    These time-series features have the benefit that they are interpretable, provide valuable insights for domain experts and support explainable machine learning models.
    
In recent years, a variety of open-source libraries like
- [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) (Matlab),
- [tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh) (Python), and
- [tsfeature](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures) (R),

among many others, have been published, which support the systematic extraction of features from time-series.

These libraries combine established algorithms from statistics, signal processing, time-series analysis, and non-linear dynamics to characterize time-series.
   
The workshop on *Systematic Feature Engineering for Time-Series Data Mining* is organized as part of the
[21st IEEE International Conference on Data Mining](https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz), which will be held from 7-10 December 2021 in Auckland, New Zealand.

The workshop seeks to connect the data mining community with researchers and industry professionals who are using systematic time-series feature engineering.

The workshop organizers are seeking contributions on systematic time-series feature engineering (STSFE), including:
- time-series data mining,
- pattern recognition on time-series,
- explainable machine learning on STSFE,
- domain-specific applications,
- novel algorithms for time-series feature extraction,
- dimensionality reduction,
- time-series classification,
- time-series regression,
- industry applications,
- event sequences and other types of ordered data like language time-series.

Authors are invited to submit original papers, which have not been published elsewhere and which are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference or workshop.
   
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Workshop Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the workshop, originality, significance, and clarity.

The accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
